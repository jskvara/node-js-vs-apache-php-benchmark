= Configuration =

== Apache modules ==
All unused Apache modules were removed for better performance. 

In folder `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled` were only following files:
{{{
authz_host.load
mime.conf
mime.load
php5.conf
php5.load
}}}

== Removed headers ==
Lot of headers, that are send by Apache, had to be removed, because NodeJS sends much less headers.

*Remove X-Powered-By:*

In file `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini` on (line 260) set:
{{{
expose_php = Off
}}}

*Remove Server signature:*

In Apache configuration set:
{{{
ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod
}}}

*Remove KeepAlive header:*

Set in Apache config:
{{{
KeepAlive: Off
}}}
