# Conclusion #

According to this benchmark nodeJs is much faster than Apache with PHP. NodeJs can serve more concurrent connections, but it consumes more memory and CPU.

Both of these have its own advantages and disadvantages. NodeJs is very fast, it is a good choice when we care about performance and concurrent connections. It is also useful to use JavaScript on the server side and on the client side, but this is a new concept. It needs time to develop frameworks and libraries for this, to be successful and spread.
We have to develop everything from scratch and documentation is also not so good.

We use Apache when we need a lot of various modules, useful scripts or special settings. Apache is the mostly used web server, everything is a very well documented and there are a lot of tutorials and tips on the Internet.
